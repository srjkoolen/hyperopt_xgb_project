# Hyperopt GXBoost project
In this repo you will find a hyperparameter tuning modelselection framework using Hyperopt and XGBoost. 

The idea of this project is to build a framework for finding the optimum hyperparameters for a XGBoost model using hyperopt. 

As example: the sklearn iris dataset has been used to showcase the working principles of hyperopt.
